# Costom-Model-Detection
This project implements an image classification model using a Tiny VGG16-inspired Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a subset of the Food-101 dataset, focusing on just three categories: Pizza, Steak, and Sushi.

üß† Model Architecture
	‚Ä¢	A compact, VGG16-inspired CNN (Tiny VGG)
	‚Ä¢	Stack of convolutional layers + ReLU + max pooling
	‚Ä¢	Fully connected (dense) layers for classification


 üì¶ Dataset
	‚Ä¢	Subset of Food-101 dataset with 3 classes: Pizza, Steak, and Sushi
	‚Ä¢	Around 255 training images and 75 testing images per class (as per original split)

‚öôÔ∏è Libraries Used
	‚Ä¢	Python
	‚Ä¢	PyTorch & Torchvision
	‚Ä¢	Matplotlib, NumPy
